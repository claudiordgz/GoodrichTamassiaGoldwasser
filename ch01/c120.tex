Python's random module includes a function \texttt{shuffle(data)} that accepts a list of elements and randomly reorders the elements so that each possible order occurs with equal probability. The random module includes a more basic function \texttt{randint(a, b)} that returns a uniformly random integer from a to b (including both endpoints). Using only the \texttt{randint} function, implement your own version of the shuffle function.
