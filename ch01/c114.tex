Write a short Python function that takes a sequence of integer values and determines if there is a distinct pair of numbers in the sequence whose product is odd.

In this method what we do first is remove all the repeated elements, then we just extract all the odd numbers. Multiply any of the odd numbers and you get an odd number. Any even number multiplied by an odd number returns an even number.
