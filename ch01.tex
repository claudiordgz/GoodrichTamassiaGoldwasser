The first chapter in the book is all about learning to handle Python syntax. Subjects include objects, control flow, functions, I/O operations, exceptions, iterators and generators, namespaces, modules, and scope. There is nothing regarding python packaging to redistribute your own module, which is a subject of its own.

All exercises will be presented with their own Python Doctest documentation to allow testing. To run them in your own python package you can copy paste the text and add a main like the following:

\begin{lstlisting}[title=DoctestMain]
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
\end{lstlisting}

This is just to try to keep it as simple as possible while adding how to run the code in your own work environment.

\ProTip{JetBrains Pycharm is awesome, I really recommend it, plus they got a Community Edition if you are pennyless like me. The colors, the functionality it just rocks. \textbf{Plus the IDE can run the examples without the need of using a main function.}}


\ProTip{I like to use Anaconda for my Python distro, but the standalone Python $2.7$ or $>=3$ works too.}

The exercises in the first chapter are fun, no joke. I've seen what's coming in chapter 2 and those exercises look terrible because they are open ended questions, but they are also important concepts.
